# Starship Configuration - `~/.config/starship.toml`
#
#     Starship is the minimal, blazing fast, and extremely customizable
#     prompt for any shell! The prompt shows information you need while
#     you're working, while staying sleek and out of the way.
#     https://starship.rs/
#
#     You can change default `~/.config/starship.toml` file location
#     with `STARSHIP_CONFIG` environment variable:
